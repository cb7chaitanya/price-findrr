# Price Findrr

Price Findrr is a one stop solution for all your price tracking needs

## Tech Stack

* Next Js
* Typescript
* Zod
* Tailwind CSS
* Nodemailer

## Features

As the name suggests, price findrr tracks product history and status for you, automating the tasks of scoping out the right time to buy any product from E-Commerce websites (currently only supports amazon.in)

Once you start tracking a product, it will keep a regular track of mainly 3 things for you:

* Discount Rate of the product has gone above the threshold (30%) or not
* Lowest price since you started tracking the price has been reached or not
* Is the tracked product back in stock or not

It keeps track of all the three things above and sends you mails for your tracked products accordingly
